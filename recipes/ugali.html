    <p>Ugali, also known as posho, sima, and other names, is a type of corn meal made from maize or corn flour in several countries in Africa. It is cooked in boiling water or milk until it reaches a stiff or firm dough-like consistency</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Cup flour (more or less)</li>
        <li>2 Cups water (more or less)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="l1">
        <li>Boil water until it bubbles. The water should be very hot. This ensures the ugali will cook perfectly</li>
        <li>Add a cup full of flour into the water. Let it cook a few seconds until water starts to cover the flour</li>
        <li>Use a wooden spoon to quickly start mixing the flour and water</li>
        <li>Add a handful of flour and continue to mix the water and flour it will start to come together</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and keep turning the ugali as it continues to stick together</li>
        <li>Gather the ugali and press it onto the side of the sufuria</li>
        <li>Place the wooden spoon under the ugali and form into a ball in the middle of the sufuria</li>
        <li>Repeat pressing the ugali on the side of the sufuria and turning it to the middle</li>
        <li>Once the ugali has become firm, turn it once more and smoothen it into a round. You will know your ugali is ready once you start to smell the aroma clearly</li>
        <li>Turn the ugali over onto a plate</li>
        <li>Dip the wooden spoon into water and use it to smoothen the ugali into a round ball on the plate</li>
        <li>Serve the ugali whole or slice. Enjoy with your favorite stew, meat, veggies, fish etc</li>
